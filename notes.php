        <h3>100 Ways of Seeing an Unequal World by Bob Suteliffe</h3>
        <p>Suteliffe, Bob. <em>100 Ways of Seeing an Unequal World.</em> Zed Books, 2001.</p>
        <p>I was in McFarlin when I stumbled accross this book while looking for another title, when I (admitedly) judged a book by its cover and thought this one might be interesting. Much to my delight it was a gold mine. Filled with graphs and charts depicting the inequality of the world it was right up my ally. Interestingly enough, this book was also first published in Spanish! Although it is a bit outdated by now, the graphical analysis of world inequalities is at the heart of my paper proposal and I am very excited to check out the list of references that will potentially lead me to more undated statistics. </p>
        <p>pg. 1</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Dos linajes solos hay en el mundo, como decía una abuela mía, que son el tener y el no tener.<br/></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This quote from <em>Don Quijote de la Mancha</em> reminds me a surprising amount to Voltaire’s <em>Candide</em> and Pangloss’s theory that “everything is best when it is worst.” Although they are saying two very different things (this quote roughly translates to: <em>There are two types of families in the world, those who have and those who don’t</em>). A quick google search tells me that <em>Candide</em> post-dates the publication of <em>Don Quijote de la Mancha</em> which would—if anything—suggest that Voltaire channeled a bit of Miguel de Cervantes here rather than the other way around.</p>
        <p>pg. 2</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I believe that it is imporant for socialists today to recapture the egalitarian spirit which was the heart of the historical utopian socialisms, including Marxism (3). Equality in this tradition is very far from homogeneity or conformity; it means the protection of freedom through equal civil and political rights and distribution according to need and not according to the ability to pay.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The first thing that comes to mind when I read this is Ayn Rand&#39;s <em>Anthem</em>. I feel as if I am constantly baffled by how we can continue to be confronted with the same problems and conundrums hundreds of years later despite all of our &#39;advancements.&#39; Can we really be &#39;improving&#39; if we still behave just as bad as some of our &#39;barbaric&#39; ancestors?</p>
        <p>pg. 9</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>That question is whether the multiple inequalities which we observe today, regardless of how they have changed in the recent or remote past, reveal unacceptable social injustices…My own reading of the evidence is that it would not give Sancho Panza&#39;s grandmother much cause to change the opinion she formed four hundred years ago.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Wow. Talk about a heavy read. Although I have already finished part I of this book, I keep thinking back to this passage from the introduction. What I find particuarly striking here is his reference to the opening quote in this book—a line taken from <em>Don Quijote de la Manacha</em> that, at least for me, really drives home the idea that inequality in the world is nothing new. Something that makes solving some of the problems of today that much more impossible.</p>

        <h3>World War II in Numbers by Peter Doyle</h3>
        <p>Doyle, Peter. <em>World War II in Numbers: An Infographic Guide to the Conflict, its Conduct, and its Casualties</em>. A &amp; C Black, 2013.</p>
        <p>After randomly finding this book in the stacks of McFarlin, I skimmed through the pages looking for data visualization inspiration. Below are my comments and opinions on the methods used to present information.</p>
        <p>pg. 156</p>
        <p>A chart on this page shows the numbers of casualities by month representing a year as a circle. Since I don’t often think of a calendar year as being circular, it’s an interesting way to show the progression of time that seems to flow more naturally than a line of rectangles. </p>
        <p>As a side note: why aren’t there 360 days in a year? Why <em>are</em> there 365 degrees in a circle? Wouldn’t it be neat if they had the same amount? </p>
        <p>pg. 34</p>
        <p>Avoid having too much information on one page. It is really overwhelming when looking at it, and makes me just want to skip over it rather than take the time to try and understand what it is telling me. </p>
        <p>As a side note: I wonder if this is similar to why learning to write clearly is so important and why Dr. Peter’s is having us focus on telling stories. If we can’t convey our ideas then it becomes practically impossible to be understood both in the sense that people wont be willing to meet us half way and in the sense that on the off chance they do make it half way they are uninterested in going the rest of the way. </p>
        <p>pg.143</p>
        <p>There are quite a few graphs in this book that use little dots or mini people icons or some other definitive quantity to illustrate the total amount of something compared to those in other countries I really like this approach. After reading a bit about Edward R. Tufte earlier today and his idea of a ‘macro/micro’ data design in that from far away it just appears to be a bar graph, but close up you realize there is more than just lines to help you understand the information. </p>

        <h3>A Guide to Analying Data with Python by Ben Welsh</h3>
        <p>Welsh, Ben. <em>First Python Notebook</em>. California Civic Data Collection, <a href='www.firstpythonnotebook.org' target='_blank'>www.firstpythonnotebook.org</a>. Accessed Jan 2018.</p>
        <p>A github repository containing the code I produced from this online course can be found <a href='https://www.github.com/okridgway/first-python-notebook/blob/master/prop-64-analysis.ipynb'>here</a>. I really like how github does version control and think I will use it to keep track of the code for this project once I get into the actual data manipulation.</p>
        <p>This course consisted of a 15-part video series where Ben Welsh, from the LA Times, walks you though how to get started with jupyter notebook in order to begin manipulating data with python and its functionalities.</p>

        <h3>Empathy and its Implications in Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>&quot;Empathetic Implications.&quot; <em>Cyberculture Since 1949</em>. University of Tulsa. 1 Feb 2018. Class Disconsciouslycussion. </p>
        <p>On Thurdsday we had a rather interesting discussion about how empathy and the degree to which people <em>care</em> about others impacts the way we solve problems. We began our discussion by considering how triage doctors are required to remove themselves from the situation in order to objectively analyze the situation and make practical decisions about which patient to care for first. It&#39;s an interesting question. In a profession where it seems is first and foremost about caring, how do you stop yourself from caring? </p>
        <p>The conversation then shifted to considering what happens when people become too removed from the situation and forget that they are dealing with people rather than problems that can be solved with pencil and paper. It was either Dana or Madi who brought up the problem that we seem to currently be facing where half the population seems to be diagnosed with ADHD based solely on a generalization of symptoms rather than considering the case as a whole for each individual. </p>
        <p>The dicussion also touched on social services and how its necessary to maintain a certain distance from your work in order to keep in mind what is realistic and best for everyone rather than just how you can &quot;fix&quot; the problem. This same problem is often found in unhealthy relationships where someone (conciously or otherwise) thinks that they can &quot;fix&quot; their partner, despite the fact that it is generally believed that a desire to &quot;fix&quot; someone should be an indication of two people being incompatible rather than caring for them. </p>
        <p>All in all, this got me thinking. If I am to be writing about inequality and looking at the data, is there a way that I should include more of the human element to things in order to ensure that I recognize that each number and statistic represents real-life beings rather than just arbitrary numbers? Is there a way I could include a first-hand narrative in my essay in order to highlight the privilege that we have? </p>
        <p>I wonder if a side-by-side chronology of someones day here, in the US, and in another country such as Venezuela or India would provide any additional meaning to the conceptualization of the numbers and metrics that I want to look at. </p>
        <p>I could also look at how people spend their time, which would be interesting, but then might also be too removed from the individual aspect of human inequality to fully appreciate the idea behind attempting to incorporate ways to be more empathetic in a data driven world. </p>

        <h3>How to Make Dope Shit</h3>
        <p>Blinderman, Ilia. &quot;How to Make Dope Shit; Part 1: Working with Data&quot; <em>The Pudding</em>, Polygraph, <a href='https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-1/.' target='_blank'>https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-1/.</a> Accessed 9 Feb. 2018.</p>
        <p>Blinderman, Ilia. &quot;How to Make Dope Shit; Part 2: Design&quot; <em>The Pudding</em>, Polygraph, <a href='https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-2/.' target='_blank'>https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-2/.</a> Accessed 9 Feb. 2018.</p>
        <p>pt. 1</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Broadly, the three components of our work are:</p>
            <ol start=''>
                <li>Data</li>
                <li>Visualization</li>
                <li>Writing</li>

            </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Its interesting that this seems to suggest saving writing for the end, and focusing on the data and visualization first. Especially since I was planning on doing it in the exact opposite way. Maybe I should consider switching it? In retrospect, it does seem rather odd to attempt to write an essay prior to actually knowing any of the statistics.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to remember that you don&#39;t need to worry — learning to program is exactly as infuriating and as dispiriting for you as it is for everyone else. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As an entirely self taught-amature web developer—who often feels like I waste half my life away at my wits-end because I can&#39;t figure out why something is not working only to discover 3 hours later that it is all due to a comma that should be a semicolon—this is comforting.</p>
        <p>pt. 2</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>…incredibly useful resource when it came to helping me understand both general HTML/CSS, and the way that D3, the JavaScript lirbary that we use for data-riven visualizations, works.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Heyo! Shout out to Nietesh for showing me what D3 is. It&#39;s funny how things tend to circle back around to themselves sometimes. </p>
        <p>Part 2 of <em>How to Make Dope Shit</em> further iterated the idea of sketching out what the visualization would look like rather than just jumping in head first and going full speed ahead. I guess I better get sketching then. <br/></p>

        <h3>Undoing Privilege by Bob Pease</h3>
        <p>Pease, Bob. <em><a href='https://encore.utulsa.edu/iii/encore/record/C__Rb2942563?lang=eng&suite=def'>Undoing Privilege: Unearned Advantage in a Divided World.</a></em> Zed Books, 2010.</p>
        <p><em>Note: This reader&#39;s log is very long. My applogies.</em></p>
        <p>p. 4</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>However, such terms focus on the behavior of individuals and groups and <strong>usually ignore the wider social context in which distrimination takes place.</strong> Mostly, the individual is blamed for being prejudiced <strong>rather than identifying the ways in which their behavior is socially reinforced and normalized</strong> (Wildman and Davis 2000).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is right on the money. When considering racism, I find it often helpful to consider different senarios and what I would do in them. For example: when walking down the street at night and seeing a large shady-looking white man coming the other direction, would you cross the street to avoid them? What if this man were black? In considering these sorts of questions you have to question your inherent bias. If you would cross the street, why? And why is it that we are quick to lable individuals as racist without considering the enviornment in which they grew up in? Where we not socialized to believe certain things? Taught that stereotypes exist for a reason? It reminds me of David Foster Wallace&#39;s <em>This is Water,</em> and the fact that we often forget what water really is.</p>
        <p>p.6</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If we focus only on discrimination and oppression, we reinforce the invisibility of privilege. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Which is why recognizing our privilege is so damn important.</p>
        <p>p. 7</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Elites are those who have considerable wealth and power usually localed in politics and business....Lenski (1966: 43) tried to answer the question of &#39;who gets what and why&#39;, and argued that &#39;privilege is largely a function of power&#39;.</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>&#39;ordinary men [sic], even today, are prone to explain and to justify power and wealth in terms of knowledge and ability&#39; (Mills 1956: 351).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>p. 8</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Sidanius and Pratto (1999: 31-2) identify the main benefits that accrue from privilege:</p>
            <p>possession of a disproportionately large share of positive social value or all those material and symbolic things for which people strive. Examples of positive social value are such things as political authority and power, good and plentiful food, splendid homes, the best available health care, wealth and high social status’. Individuals come to possess these bene ts by virtue of his or her prescribed membership in a particular socially constructed group such as race, religion, clan, tribe, ethnic group or social class.</p>
            <p>What is important here is that the groups to which people belong are more likely to make them privileged than their individual abili- ties. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>p. 9</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>McIntosh constructed a list of advantages that were available to her as a white person that were not available to people of colour under racism.To make sense of how individuals gain these bene ts, we need to identify the key dimensions of privilege: the invisibility of privilege by those who have it; the power of the privileged group to determine the social norm; the naturalisation of privilege and the sense of entitlement that accompanies privilege.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>p. 10</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>One of the consequences of this is that members of privileged groups are unlikely to be aware of how others do not have access to the benefits that they receive. Thus they are unlikely to be able to acknowledge the experiences of those who are margin- alised. Consequently, many privileged individuals may oppress people without being aware of it.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>p. 12</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>People in privileged groups feel that their lives are normal.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>p. 13</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Thus some social statuses are valued, while others are devalued. For example, in Western society: </p>

        <p>This table would be interesting to use as a basis for social standing and see what the world averages are (and what the US average is) and then allow the reader to select where they fall and subsequentally calculate how privileged they are.</p>
        <p>p. 15</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Members of privileged groups usually have a sense of entitlementto the privileges they enjoy. As Rosenblum and Travis (1996: 141)state: ‘The sense of entitlement that one has a right to be respected,acknowledged, protected and rewarded – is so much taken for grantedby those of us in non-stigmatised statuses, that they are often shockedand angered when it is denied them.’</p>
            <p>Men’s sense of entitlement can result in violence against women.</p>

        <p>As Pease has noted quite a few times throughout his book, one of the key aspects to combating unearned privilege is through the recognition of it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>A number of development writers have noted that after more than thirty years of development programmes and foreign aid, the poorest countries of the world are worse o than they were before Western interventions (Verhelst 1990; Escobar 1995; Tucker 1999; Munck 1999)</p>

            <p>In the last few years, a number of publications have documented the experiences of Western development workers who went to non- Western countries to ‘help’, only to discover that what they had to o er was not what was needed. Subsequently, as they developed awareness of their own assumptions and the assumptions of the programmes they were embedded within, they wrote about the fail- ures of dominant models of development (Danaher 2001; Boulet 2003; Goudge 2003; Bolten 2008). Danaher (2001) re ects on how he was once told by a grassroots activist in Africa that, while it was appreciated that he came there because he wanted to help, if he really wanted to help, he could do more by going back to his own country and working to change government and corporate policies which supported undemocratic leaders in non-Western countries.</p>

        <p>This, if anything makes me question if what I&#39;m doing, as far as EWB goes, is worth it. Do the people really want it? Is it helpful? Or are we just imposing on them and their society because we think we&#39;re better. Maybe this is something I should talk to Dr. Ford about. </p>

            <p>It comes as no surprise that a person’s ecological footprint is directly related to his or her wealth and income. Those in rich countries have the largest ecological footprints. United Nations statistics state that <strong>80 per cent of the goods and services produced from the resources of the earth were consumed by the wealthiest 20 per cent of the world’s population</strong> (Wackernagel and Rees 1996). A baby born in the United States will consume twenty times the resources of a baby born in Africa or India during their respective life times (Sago 2008). While the wealthiest 20 per cent owns 87 per cent of motor vehicles in the world, the poorest 20 per cent owns less than 1 per cent of motor vehicles. The top 20 per cent of wealthiest people consume 58 per cent of the energy of the world compared to the poorest 20 per cent consuming less than 5 per cent (Hossay 2006).</p>

            <p>These developments provide us with a conceptual and pedagogical framework for engaging members of privileged groups about their unearned entitlements. Much of this work also takes these strategies out of the university classroom and into government and community-based forums where privilege-holders can be challenged about their advantages.</p>

        <p>World Bank. <em>Atlas of Global Development: A Visual Guide to the World&#39;s Greatest Challenges.</em> Glasgow : Collins and the World Bank. World Bank. </p>
        <p>Goodness me, talk about heavy. Although this book is a bit outdated, I stumbled accross it while exploring the stacks of McFarlin and thought it was particuarly relevant. </p>
        <p>One thing that this book does that I really like is how it divided itself by various metrics without being too overwhelming. Each topic consists of 2-4 pages dicussing the topic with various statistics, charts and pictures for visualizations. Following each of these sections is a two-page spread of a world map depicting one of the metrics mentioned on the preceeding pages. Each section is color coded differently so that it is easy to tumb through the book and know where the topics being discussed change. </p>
        <p>One thing I didn&#39;t like about this book is its lack of foundational comprehension it presented. Sure, I can look at a graph and see one line is a lot taller than another, and interpret that as worse (or best, depending on the metrics) but it doesn&#39;t give me any sort of feel for what it is <em>really</em> trying to tell me, since it is only a line on a peice of paper. Hopefully, my final product can provide more of an insight to these numbers than this can.</p>
        <p>p. 43</p>
        <p>Some of the metrics that the World Bank used are really interesting. Such as on this page and the graph showing the mortality rate of children under the age of 5 relative to the amount of education that their mother has. It&#39;s quite astounding actually.</p>
        <p>p. 130</p>
        <p>At the very end of this book there is a breif section outlining why statistics are so imporant and thanking all statisticians for their service to aquiering such statistics. I&#39;ve never seen something like this before and find it rather interesting.</p>

        <h3>What Does it Mean to Die? by Rachel Aviv</h3>
        <p>Aviv, Rachel. “What Does It Mean to Die?” <em>The New Yorker</em>, The New Yorker, 8 Feb. 2018, <a href='www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/05/what-does-it-mean-to-die.'>newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/05/what-does-it-mean-to-die</a>. Accessed 15 Feb. 2018.</p>

            <p>“No one was listening to us, and I can’t prove it, but I really feel in my heart: if Jahi was a little white girl, I feel we would have gotten a little more help and attention.” </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This reminds me of a portion of Pease&#39;s book <em>Undoing Privilege</em> where he talks about how we often don&#39;t realize the extent of our privilege. If I get pulled over for speeding and let off with a warning, how much of my white-ness is contributing to getting off the hook for a ticket? Is this something that I should point out to the officer and subsequently request to be given a ticket?<br/></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>African-Americans are twice as likely as whites to ask that their lives be prolonged as much as possible, even in cases of irreversible coma—a preference that likely stems from fears of neglect. A large body of research has shown that black patients are less likely to get appropriate medications and surgeries than white ones are, regardless of their insurance or education level, and more likely to receive undesirable medical interventions, like amputations.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Although this isn&#39;t as applicable to world development as a whole, it does present an interesting perspective on some of the inequalities and privileges that occur within the United States.</p>
