        <h1>The Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Project Description and Significance</h2>
        <p>We&#39;re the middle-class-college educated-9-5-white-collar workers who are frustrated by slow internet and expired coupon codes. Our bad days consist of workplace stress, embarrassing situations, and traffic jams-but rarely do we take the time to appreciate just how fortunate we really are. </p>
        <p>In one way or another we are all privileged. However, we are so convinced that the world revolves around us that we refuse to see anything that would suggest otherwise. We honk at people driving slowly because we know they&#39;re doing so just to make us late. We&#39;re rude to customer service representatives because we know that they make exceptions for everyone else and are being intentionally annoying when they say they &#39;can&#39;t help us.&#39; We take two when the sign clearly says to only take one since we know that if they knew how rough of a day we were having, they would want us to take two as well. </p>
        <p>This project aims to enlighten the average reader and help them realize that their shit does in-fact stink. According to the American Journal of Psychology over the past decade, the rates of depression has increased significantly, suggesting that we are not happy. It&#39;s understandable. Just watching the news and following politics is enough to see that there are quite a few things to be upset about. But despite what the headlines and twitter bots may suggest, we still have it pretty good. The project outlined in the proposal below hopes to highlight the privileges that we often take for granted and demonstrate that while it may not be perfect, America is already great. </p>
        <h2>Supporting Literature</h2>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Relevant background literature for this project consists of pieces broaching various forms of privilege in society and in particular how privileged groups are often blind to their undeserved advantages. In order to get a broader understanding of the relevant literature, the supporting texts will include pieces on different types of domestic privilege and systematic oppression as well as pieces regarding first-world privilege and related topics on more of an international basis. Key sources include Bob Pease&#39;s Undoing Privilege and Peggy McIntosh&#39;s White Privilege and Male Privilege; both of which describe the necessity (and difficulty) of recognizing class privilege and attempting to dismantle it from the inside. </p>
        <h4>Content</h4>
        <p>Since the most heavily relied upon source of textual evidence for this project consists of raw data rather than distinct pieces of literature, additional support is derived from the &#39;key insights&#39; that will be evaluated in the final paper. Such key insights (minimum of 5) will be finalized by Friday, March 2nd, as outlined in Section 3, Timeline, below.</p>
        <h4>Medium</h4>
        <p>As a primary source for effective visual essays, The Pudding will be provide considerable support for how to design effective visualizations that are tied together in a convincing and compelling way. In order to gain a basic understanding of how to create such visualizations Ben Welsh&#39;s First Python Notebook video series will be used extensively as a guide on how to use Python to manipulate data. Additionally, the online community of developers and programmers who contribute to Stack Overflow will prove to be an invaluable source of information, explanations, help, tips, and tricks for good coding practices that will assist in bringing this project to fruition.</p>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>Statistically speaking, it is easy to know that there are over seven billion people in the world. Genuinely understanding this fact, however, is something else entirely. When it comes to comprehending large numbers, humans generally suck. We&#39;re easily confused by complex mathematical operations such as addition and subtraction, baffled by the fraction&#39;s unwieldly form and perpetually perplexed when the alphabet shows up in our number soup.</p>
        <p>In order to combat these weaknesses, this project aims to convey its message through an alternative means. Specifically, it will leave the black-and-white two-dimensional slices of trees behind and embrace a future that has long been coming through creating an interactive and dynamic visual story. In order for this idea to come to fruition, several different aspects must be considered and thought out prior to their attempted execution. Such aspects and a brief explanation of what they include are outlined below. </p>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>In order to gain a sufficient understanding of the subject&#39;s context and background, a survey of relevant texts will be explored and an annotated bibliography will be crafted to serve as a brief guide for future investigations to expand on portions of the subject that this project does not cover. After a baseline understanding of the topic is acquired a variety of &#39;visual essays&#39; will be evaluated in terms of their ability to capture their audience. These will ultimately serve as a source of inspiration in addition to being an invaluable resource come time to designing original visualizations and contemplating how best to illustrate various types of information. </p>
        <h4>Content</h4>
        <p>Once a foundational understanding of the topic literature is obtained and a general idea of the story to be told is determined, relevant data will be gathered from various databases and datasets freely available on the internet. These data will then be analyzed using Excel and Python where their relationships will be determined and key facts noted. Conclusions from the data will then be incorporated into a story where it will serve as a tool to help the reader realize their own journey to perceiving their privilege. </p>
        <h4>Medium</h4>
        <p>The medium of this project&#39;s message will be delivered via an interactive and dynamic platform that will engage the entirety of the reader&#39;s attention. It will be produced using a combination of Python, HTML, CSS and PHP code to create an intuitive and aesthetically appealing website which will function as the primary platform of the story. Foreseeable limitations include difficulties coding due to a lack of skill and experience. As such, Plan B has been outlined below.</p>
        <h4>Plan B</h4>
        <p>In the event that the methods outlined above are too ambitious and cannot be completed by the end of the semester (with sanity in-tact), Plan B provides a simpler alternative that will nonetheless encompass the major aspects of the proposed method without sacrificing sanity. </p>
        <p>Specifically, it suggests the removal of interactive and dynamic content from the list of things to-do and is satisfied with static visualizations and images on an intuitive and aesthetically appealing website that will nonetheless be published on the world wide web. It should be noted that this is not a get-out-of-jail-free card, but an additional basket to put a few eggs in. Although its final product may not be as powerful a tool as (the untitled) Plan A, it will be sufficient to get the point across.</p>
